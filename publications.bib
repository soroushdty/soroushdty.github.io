	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine abuse during pregnancy is associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Methamphetamine induces reproductive damage in adults; however, its effect has not been studied during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of methamphetamine exposure during pregnancy on the reproductive system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 pregnant Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups (n = 5/group), they received daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or methamphetamine (5, and 10 mg/kg) from day 10 until the end of pregnancy. One adult male offspring was selected from each dam. Subjects were euthanized, and their testis was removed. Sperm samples from cauda epididymis were analyzed for sperm concentration, morphology, and motility. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay was used to detect apoptotic cells. Levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X-protein were measured using Western blot.
RESULTS: Methamphetamine significantly decreased sperm concentration (5 mg vs. saline: p = 0.001, 10 mg vs. saline: p {\textless} 0.001), normal sperm morphology (saline vs. 10 mg: p = 0.001), and motility (p: saline vs. 5 mg = 0.004, 5 mg vs. 10 mg = 0.011, saline vs. 10 mg {\textless} 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner. There was a significantly higher number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling -positive cells and higher exposure. Moreover, Bcl-2 associated X-protein was increased, and Bcl-2 was decreased in these rats.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows that chronic methamphetamine exposure during intrauterine period can induce apoptosis of seminiferous tubules and decrease sperm quality in adult rats. Moreover, we showed that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is involved in this process. Further studies are required to identify the complete molecular pathway of these results.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion are used against cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19. This study aims to compare their outcomes, costs, and side-effects.
METHODS: Survival, costs and side-effects were compared in intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving plasmapheresis (n = 49), hemoperfusion (n = 20), or none (n = 107), followed until death or discharge.
RESULTS: Plasmapheresis survival time was higher than hemoperfusion or controls (HR = 0.764, p = 0.397 and HR = 0.483, p = 0.002, respectively), although the latter diminished after controlling for age and disease severity (p = 0.979). There was no significant difference in ICU costs for plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion (p = 0.738) while both costed more than controls (both p {\textless} 0.001). Hypocalcemia and thrombocytopenia incidence did not differ between two groups (p = 0.124 and p = 0.389, respectively) while being higher than controls in plasmapheresis (both p {\textless} 0.001) and hemoperfusion (p {\textless} 0.001 and p = 0.056, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion do not differ significantly in patient survival, ICU costs and side-effects with a higher incidence of hypocalcemia and thrombocytopenia compared witcontrols.},

We replaced the prosthetic endovascular graft just below the left subclavian artery to the top of the superior mesenteric artery. Amplatzer™ vascular plug was replaced below the diaphragm in a closed transfemoral procedure to prevent re-entry.

	abstract = {Background: Menstrual disorders are common among women and can cause discomfort. Several environmental factors are considered to be associated with these disorders.
Aim: To investigate the prevalence of psychological stress and menstrual disorders among Iranian medical students and to assess the environmental factors, including stress, that are associated with menstrual disorders.
Methods and material: This cross-sectional study was conducted on female medical students of Islamic Azad University Tehran Medical Sciences Branch, Tehran, Iran. Demographics, menstrual patterns and stress profile of the sample were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with stress and menstrual disorders.
Results: Out of 358 participants, 10.1\% had a menstrual cycle {\textless} 21 days (polymenorrhea), 2.8\% had a menstrual cycle of {\textgreater}35 days (oligomenorrhea), and 9.2\% had irregular menstrual cycle (metrorrhagia). Moreover, 13.7\% had period lengths of {\textgreater}7 days (hypermenorrhea). 51.1\% of the sample experienced heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). The average stress score was 19.87Â±9.09. BMI, cigarette and hookah smoking were significantly associated with higher stress (OR=1.158, 1.123 and 1.117, respectively). Polymenorrhea was significantly associated with age at menarche and stress score (OR=0.735 and 1.046, respectively). Metrorrhagia was also significantly associated with age at menarche and stress score (OR=0.757 and 1.043, respectively). New interns were less likely to have hypermenorrhea and metrorrhagia compared to pre-interns (OR=0.173 and 0.500, respectively).
Conclusions: Stress was associated with short and irregular menstrual cycles. There was a higher prevalence of stress and menstrual disorders among medical students compared to general population, which warrants further investigation and action.},

	abstract = {Background: Differentiating the type of benign ovarian cyst can result in better care.
Aims: To measure CA-125, CA 19-9, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum and cyst fluid of patients with benign ovarian cysts and whether these biomarkers can be used to identify the type of the cyst.
Methods and materials: Patients with benign ovarian cysts undergoing laparoscopic cystectomy were included. Cyst types were determined histologically. Levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, CEA and AFP were measured in serum and cyst fluid.
Results: 98 cysts (25 functional, 12 endometrioma, 15 dermoid, 28 mucinous cystadenoma, 18 serous cystadenoma) were evaluated. There was a significant difference in levels of CA 125 and CA 19-9 in serum and CA-125, CA 19-9 and CEA in cyst fluid. For diagnostic purposes, a value of ≥35 IU/mL for serum CA 125 predicted endometriomas with a sensitivity of 91.7\% and a specificity of 91.9\%. A value of ≤22.5 IU/mL for cyst fluid CA 19-9, predicted functional cysts with a of sensitivity of 92\% and specificity of 95.2\%. A value of ≥100 ng/mL for cyst fluid CEA, predicted mucinous cysts with a sensitivity of 96.4\% and specificity of 96.7\%.
Conclusion: Levels of CA-125, CA 19-9 and CEA in serum and cyst fluid of patients with benign ovarian cysts can be used as a diagnostic tool in patient evaluation with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. This finding can be used in conjunction with other methods such as ultrasound, especially in cases that are harder to diagnose.
