<!--more-->
Plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion are two extracorporeal blood exchange therapies used extensively in critically ill COVID-19 patients at the height of the pandemic. While some studies demonstrated improvements in clinical measures, their high costs present a significant challenge. his study is a followup of our previously paper published [Link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36324189/).

## Goal
This project evaluates the cost-effectiveness of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion in COVID-19 survivors post-hospital discharge, focusing on long-term clinical outcomes and economic sustainability.

## Key Steps
- Patient Follow-up: ICU-discharged patients were follow-up at three time pointsâ€”immediately after discharge, one month, and six months.
- Data Collection: Vital signs, laboratory markers, quality of life (via EQ-5D-5L questionnaire and WHO life table), and direct medical costs.
- Analysis: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping, cost-effectiveness scatterplots, and acceptability curves following CHEERS 2022 guidelines.
- Outcome Evaluation: Assessment of clinical improvements and economic impact (hospitalization costs, QALY).

## Tools used
- Statistical Analysis: IBM SPSS v. 26
- Cost Effectiveness Analysis: R v. 4.3.3.
