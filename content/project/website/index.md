## Description
My personal website, built using Hugo, an open-source static website generator developed in Go, incorporates the Hugo Academic CV Theme by Hugo Blox. Hosted on Github pages, this website serves as a comprehensive platform showcasing my background, experience, publications, and projects.

## Future Plans
- Sharing my personal Obsidian vaults as ebooks on Python and biomedical informatics, which will be freely available on the website
- More blog posts
- Make the website bilingual by adding content in Persian
- Link personal website project with Github site repo readme.md
- Download cv fully automated: full / resume / custom
- Connecting to local Obsidian vault
