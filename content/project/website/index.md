## Description
My personal website, built using Hugo, an open-source static website generator developed in Go, incorporates the Hugo Academic CV Theme by Hugo Blox. Hosted on Github pages, this website serves as a comprehensive platform showcasing my background, experience, publications, and projects.

## Future Plans
I am planning to expand the website by sharing my personal Obsidian vaults as ebooks on Python and biomedical informatics, which will be freely available. Additionally, I aim to enhance the blog section with more posts and make the website bilingual by adding content in the Persian language.
