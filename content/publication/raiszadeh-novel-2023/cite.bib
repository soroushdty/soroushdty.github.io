 abstract = {We present successful treatment of dissected thoracoabdominal aorta using combined thoracic endovascular aortic repair and transfemoral replacement of Amplatzer™ vascular plug in a 38-year-old patient. Computed tomography angiography revealed a false lumen from the left subclavian artery to the left common iliac trunk, with re-entries connecting it to the true lumen of the aorta. We replaced the prosthetic endovascular graft just below the left subclavian artery to the top of the superior mesenteric artery. Amplatzer™ vascular plug was replaced below the diaphragm in a closed transfemoral procedure to prevent re-entry. The patient was discharged in good condition and 2 years postoperation imaging showed complete pseudoaneurysm closure.},
