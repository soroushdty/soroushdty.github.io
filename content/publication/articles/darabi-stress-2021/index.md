abstract: 'Background: Menstrual disorders are common among women and can cause discomfort.
  Several environmental factors are considered to be associated with these disorders.
  Aim: To investigate the prevalence of psychological stress and menstrual disorders
  among Iranian medical students and to assess the environmental factors, including
  stress, that are associated with menstrual disorders. Methods and material: This
  cross-sectional study was conducted on female medical students of Islamic Azad University
  Tehran Medical Sciences Branch, Tehran, Iran. Demographics, menstrual patterns and
  stress profile of the sample were assessed. Logistic regression models were used
  to evaluate factors associated with stress and menstrual disorders. Results: Out
  of 358 participants, 10.1% had a menstrual cycle textless 21 days (polymenorrhea),
  2.8% had a menstrual cycle of textgreater35 days (oligomenorrhea), and 9.2% had
  irregular menstrual cycle (metrorrhagia). Moreover, 13.7% had period lengths of
  textgreater7 days (hypermenorrhea). 51.1% of the sample experienced heavy menstrual
  bleeding (menorrhagia). The average stress score was 19.87Â±9.09. BMI, cigarette
  and hookah smoking were significantly associated with higher stress (OR=1.158, 1.123
  and 1.117, respectively). Polymenorrhea was significantly associated with age at
  menarche and stress score (OR=0.735 and 1.046, respectively). Metrorrhagia was also
  significantly associated with age at menarche and stress score (OR=0.757 and 1.043,
  respectively). New interns were less likely to have hypermenorrhea and metrorrhagia
  compared to pre-interns (OR=0.173 and 0.500, respectively). Conclusions: Stress
  was associated with short and irregular menstrual cycles. There was a higher prevalence
  of stress and menstrual disorders among medical students compared to general population,
  which warrants further investigation and action.'
