abstract: 'Background: Differentiating the type of benign ovarian cyst can result
  in better care. Aims: To measure CA-125, CA 19-9, Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)
  and Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum and cyst fluid of patients with benign ovarian
  cysts and whether these biomarkers can be used to identify the type of the cyst.
  Methods and materials: Patients with benign ovarian cysts undergoing laparoscopic
  cystectomy were included. Cyst types were determined histologically. Levels of CA
  125, CA 19-9, CEA and AFP were measured in serum and cyst fluid. Results: 98 cysts
  (25 functional, 12 endometrioma, 15 dermoid, 28 mucinous cystadenoma, 18 serous
  cystadenoma) were evaluated. There was a significant difference in levels of CA
  125 and CA 19-9 in serum and CA-125, CA 19-9 and CEA in cyst fluid. For diagnostic
  purposes, a value of ≥35 IU/mL for serum CA 125 predicted endometriomas with a sensitivity
  of 91.7% and a specificity of 91.9%. A value of ≤22.5 IU/mL for cyst fluid CA 19-9,
  predicted functional cysts with a of sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95.2%.
  A value of ≥100 ng/mL for cyst fluid CEA, predicted mucinous cysts with a sensitivity
  of 96.4% and specificity of 96.7%. Conclusion: Levels of CA-125, CA 19-9 and CEA
  in serum and cyst fluid of patients with benign ovarian cysts can be used as a diagnostic
  tool in patient evaluation with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. This finding
  can be used in conjunction with other methods such as ultrasound, especially in
  cases that are harder to diagnose. Keywords: Ovarian cyst, tumor marker, CA 125,
  CA 19-9, CEA, AFP'
