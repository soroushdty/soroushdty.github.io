abstract: We present successful treatment of dissected thoracoabdominal aorta using
  combined thoracic endovascular aortic repair and transfemoral replacement of Amplatzer™
  vascular plug in a 38-year-old patient. Computed tomography angiography revealed
  a false lumen from the left subclavian artery to the left common iliac trunk, with
  re-entries connecting it to the true lumen of the aorta. We replaced the prosthetic
  endovascular graft just below the left subclavian artery to the top of the superior
  mesenteric artery. Amplatzer™ vascular plug was replaced below the diaphragm in
  a closed transfemoral procedure to prevent re-entry. The patient was discharged
  in good condition and 2 years postoperation imaging showed complete pseudoaneurysm
  closure.
